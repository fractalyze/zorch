"""Check-polynomial kernels behind the IPA fold — no EC point, no MSM.

The pieces a verifier (and an accumulation consumer) needs that touch *only* the
scalar field, factored out of `verifier.py` so they run and test on the scalar
field independent of the curve's `lax.msm` path (the same split KZG draws between
`_quotient_and_eval` and its MSMs). The generic monomial-basis vector
`b = (1, x, …, x^{n-1})` lives in `zorch.poly.univariate.powers`; the two kernels
here are IPA-specific:

- `challenge_vector` — the size-`n` vector `s` with `G_final = ⟨s, G⟩` (the one
  expensive MSM the verifier/decider owes). The dense coefficients of the check
  polynomial `h` below, built by the *exact* inverse of the prover's basis fold,
  so `⟨s, G⟩` reproduces the prover's collapsed basis by construction rather than
  by a re-derived closed form.
- `eval_challenge_poly` — `h(x) = ∏_j (1 + u_j · x^{2^{k-1-j}})`, the O(log n)
  evaluation of the check polynomial whose coefficients are `s`. This is the
  folded scalar `b` *without* materializing `s`, and the reason an accumulation
  step stays succinct: `h` is pinned by the `k = log n` challenges alone.

Both use the no-inverse form (`1 + u_j·X^…`, not `u_j⁻¹ + u_j·X^…`). That formula
IS the contract; it matches arkworks' check polynomial (the `poly-commit` crate's
`ipa_pc` succinct check, `compute_coeffs` / `evaluate`), pinned against that
oracle at zorch#339 W3 (see docs/blocks/pcs.md) so the decider's final-key MSM
byte-matches it — treat the arkworks symbol names as a pointer that may move, the
formula as the spec.

`challenge_vector` and `eval_challenge_poly` are two readings of the *same* object
— `eval_challenge_poly(u, x) == ⟨challenge_vector(u), powers(x, n)⟩` — and a test
pins that identity so the succinct path and the explicit path cannot drift.

    dense coefficients of the check polynomial `h`.

    Derived as the exact inverse of the prover's basis fold
    `G^{(j+1)}_t = G^{(j)}_t + u_j·G^{(j)}_{t+m}`: a coefficient `c` on a folded
    entry splits into `c` on the low half and `c·u_j` on the high half, so
